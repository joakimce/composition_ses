The R scripts in the find_phenos folder are meant to be run in colossus. 
They have paths in the format of colossus scripts, e.g., "/ess/p805/data/durable/" instead of "N:/durable".


Run the R scripts with the find_phenos.sh in bash on colossus to create pheno.csv files by:

1. Type "cd /ess/p805/data/durable/projects/joakim/SES_composition/scripts/1_find_phenos/"
2. Type "sbatch find_all_phenos.sh" for all phenotypes or run the .sh script for a specific phenotype
